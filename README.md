iOS Photo Upload and Display App with Firebase

Photo Upload: Users can take a new photo or select an existing photo from their device. The photo is then uploaded to Firebase Storage.
Display Uploaded Photos: The app fetches and displays the uploaded images from Firebase Firestore, showing the list of photo URLs.
